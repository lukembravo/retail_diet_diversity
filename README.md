# Retail Diet Diversity

In this methods-focused project, our group used several types correlation and regression analyses, tuned parameters for a multilayered perceptron model, and more. If we can identify key characteristics shared among the most successful stores across two Hanoi districts, we can build a model for profitability and longevity, and predict the success of new entrants or future ventures. 

With the data available to us, we were able to use the length of time a store has been open as a proxy for success. Then, in order to properly use this longevity metric as our target variable, we simply had to use ordered models such as ordered logit and probit models.

Using both machine suggestions (e.g., recursive feature elimination) and our own reasoning, we were able to identify key factors for predicting success with an accuracy significantly higher than baseline.
